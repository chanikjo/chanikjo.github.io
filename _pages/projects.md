<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">A one-factor model based on long-run consumption growth explains the risk premiums on corporate bond portfolios sorted on credit rating, credit spreads, downside risk, idiosyncratic volatility, long-term reversals, maturity, and sensitivity to the financial intermediary capital factor. The estimated risk-aversion coefficient is lower when we use the consumption growth of wealthy households over a longer horizon as a risk factor, and a model with a 20-quarter horizon yields a risk-aversion coefficient of 15, a value similar to the one estimated from equity portfolios.</span></span>

We assess the validity of our measures. Our SEPU indices vary counter-cyclically with respect to state-specific economic conditions, rise before close gubernatorial elections, and exhibit a large cross-sectional variation. We demonstrate that SEPU indices are associated with the cross-sectional variation in state-level GDP, employment, income as well as industry investment decisions. Our findings highlight the importance of economic policy uncertainty at the state level in addition to the nationwide level.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We develop a dynamic capital structure model to study how agency conflicts between managers and shareholders affect the joint determination of financing and investment decisions. We show that there are two agency conflicts with opposing effects on a managerâ€™s choice of investment: first, the consumption of private benefits channel leads managers not only to choose a lower optimal leverage, but also to underinvest, and second, compensation linked to firm size may lead managers to overinvest. We fit the model to the data and show that the average firm slightly overinvests, younger CEOs invest more than older ones, while CEOs with longer tenure overinvest more than CEOs with shorter tenure.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We survey 2,548 representative U.S. respondents to estimate subjective risk-return trade-offs across savings, government bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, and cryptocurrencies. We document robust negative relationships between perceptions of risk and return among risky assets, which are observed even among financially literate respondents. Strong asset-specific sentiments, reflected in large deviations of return perceptions from average perceptions, drive these significant negative risk-return trade-offs. Both strong optimism and pessimism contribute to negative risk-return trade-offs with similar magnitudes. These negative risk-return trade-offs translate into under-diversified portfolios, as investors avoid assets they perceive to generate low returns and high risk.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">State and local governments issue tax-exempt bonds to finance developments of affordable multi-family rental housing. These bonds represent a crucial funding source for addressing the U.S. affordable housing crisis. We find that affordable housing projects in predominantly minority neighborhoods face significantly higher borrowing costs than those in predominantly white neighborhoods. This disparity persists even among FHA-insured bonds where credit risk is essentially eliminated through federal guarantees. The effect is stronger when project neighborhoods have a higher minority concentration compared to surrounding areas, suggesting that financing costs may incentivize development in racially homogeneous communities, potentially reinforcing existing patterns of racial segregation.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">By leveraging US state-level employment protection laws, we provide evidence that such laws increase stock market participation, on both intensive and extensive margins. Young, low-income, low-wealth, and less-educated households exhibit stronger effects. Conversely, when the protection law is reversed, we observe the opposite risk-taking behaviors. Our findings remain robust across various stock market participation measures, datasets, and stacked difference-in-differences research design, underscoring the significance of employment protection in encouraging households to take financial risks, and potentially enhancing wealth accumulation. This represents a novel economic channel through which employment protection can benefit households.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">This paper studies a novel channel through which climate risks affect households&rsquo; choices of risky asset allocation: a stringent climate change regulation elevates labor income risk for households employed by high-emission industries which in turn discourages households&#39; financial risk-taking. Using staggered adoptions of climate change action plans across states, we find that climate change action plans lead to a reduction in the share of risky assets by 15% for households in high-emission industries. We also find a reduction in risky asset holdings after the stringent EPA regulation. These results are stronger with experiences of climate change-related disasters. Our study implies an unintended consequence of climate regulations for wealth inequality by discouraging low-wealth households&#39; financial risk-taking.</span></span>

Capturing intra-household risk-sharing dynamics using the conditional income correlation between spouses' industries, we find that better income risk-sharing within couples increases households' financial risk-taking. Exploiting unexpected events of spousal death, we causally identify the impact of intra-household risk-sharing on households' asset choices. Our study implies an unintended consequence of positive assortative mating, a growing tendency of couples choosing partners with similar socioeconomic statuses, which limits risk-sharing between spouses, thereby discouraging financial risk-taking.</span></span>

Given this fact, can the outperformance of green stocks over brown stocks (the "greenium") be explained as compensation for inflation risk? We find that the magnitude of the greenium decreases by 31% and 54% for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and the greenium becomes statistically insignificant after controlling for individual stocks' core inflation risk exposure. These findings are robust to excluding brown industries and are not driven by the post-COVID inflationary period. Overall, our results suggest that the greenium is in part a reflection of inflation risk compensation. </span></span>

We find that the number of data scientists employed by financial institutions causally affects their ability to earn abnormal profits. Data scientists' ability to generate abnormal profits on a stock is positively correlated to the concentration of data scientists across all institutional investors holding the stock. Institutional investors strategically adjust portfolio allocation and recruitment decisions to maximize the benefits generated by their data scientists. Consistent with the notion that the competition among data scientists speeds up the production and trade of private information, we also show that the concentration of data scientists covering a stock reduces its price informativeness in the capital market.</span></span>

Moreover, they tend to raise output prices and exhibit higher equity valuations. Our results are robust to excluding the COVID-19 period.

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="color:black">We find that U.S. households reduce their exposure to the stock market in response to an increase in the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) of not only U.S., but also to an increase in the Chinese EPU. We identify income uncertainty as a key driver of this relationship. In response to an increase in the Chinese EPU, households whose jobs belong to the industries that heavily export to China react more sensitively by lowering their stock shares in financial wealth. Moreover, the response is stronger for households in states that export to China more than other states. This evidence suggests that U.S. households respond to the Chinese EPU because an increase in the Chinese EPU potentially increases their income uncertainty. Our findings provide the first evidence on the importance of considering foreign economic policy uncertainty in explaining households' portfolio decisions.</span></span>
